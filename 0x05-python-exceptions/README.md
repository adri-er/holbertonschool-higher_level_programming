# Python exceptions (Try ... Except)

With this project I had the first contact with exceptions, understanding the difference between an exception and an error. Concepts on _how to use exceptions, when are they needed, how to handle them, how to raise an exception and clean-up actions. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description. 

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-safe_print_list.py]() | Prints x elements of a list, handling exceptions of type and index. |
| [1-safe_print_integer.py]() | Prints an integer with "{:d}".format() handling type exceptions. |
| [2-safe_print_list_integers.py]() | Prints the first x elements of a list and only integers, avoiding case it is out of index. |
| [3-safe_print_division.py]() | Divides 2 integers and prints the result using finally. |
| [4-list_division.py]() | Divides element by element of two lists handling exceptions of type, size and value. |
| [5-raise_exception.py]() | Raises a type exception. |
| [6-raise_exception_msg.py]() | Raises a name exception with a message. |
| [100-safe_print_integer_err.py]() | Prints an integer, if exception occurs prints the error on the stderr. |
| [101-safe_function.py]() | Executes a function safely. |
| [102-magic_calculation.py]() | Function that emulates a bytecode file. |


## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
Each file is a script and executes with python3. Thereby each executable can be processed as:

```
./name_of_file.py
```


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on high level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in Python_

## Authors ‚úíÔ∏è

**Adriana Echeverri** - [adri-er](https://github.com/adri-er)


This project was developed following the schedule of the foundations program in Holberton.
