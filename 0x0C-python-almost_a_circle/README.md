# Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

With this project I had the first contact with Object Oriented Programming, practicing how to create a class with public and private attributes and methods. As well, the importance and utility of the constructors __init__. All this was done in Python giving a deeper understanding of decorators. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description. 

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/0-square.py) | Creates an empty class Square that defines a square. |
| [1-square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/1-square.py) | Creates a class Square that defines a square with size attribute. |
| [2-square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/2-square.py) | Creates a class Square that defines a square with size attribute and a setter to control the value. |
| [3-square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/3-square.py) | Creates a class Square that defines a square with size attribute and a setter to control the value, as well a method area. |
| [4-square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/4-square.py) | Creates a class Square that defines a square with size attribute and a setter to control the value, as well a method area. |
| [5-square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/5-square.py) | Creates a class Square that defines a square with size attribute and a setter to control the value, as well methods to determine area and print the shape with #. |
| [6-square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/6-square.py) | Creates a class Square that defines a square with size and position attribute and a setter to control the value, as well methods to determine area and print the shape with #. |
| [100-singly_linked_list.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/100-singly_linked_list.py) | Creates class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list and creates class SinglyLinkedList that defines a singly linked list. |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
Each file is a script and executes with python3. Thereby each executable can be processed as:

```
./name_of_file.py
```
Nevertheless, these files need a test file to see the application, which is the one that is going to be executed.


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on high level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in Python_

## Authors ‚úíÔ∏è

This project was developed following the schedule of the foundations program in Holberton.
