# Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

With this project I had a closer contact with Object Oriented Programming, practicing how to create a class with public and private attributes and methods. As well, the difference between the constructors __str__ and __repr__ were studied. All this was done in Python giving a deeper understanding of decorators. There was an special focus in differencing static methods from class methods. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description. 

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/0-rectangle.py) | Creates an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. |
| [1-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/1-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with attributes width and height. |
| [2-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/2-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with attributes width and height and has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area. |
| [3-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/3-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with attributes width and height and has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area, if you print the object prints a rectangle with #. |
| [4-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/4-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with attributes width and height and has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area, if you print the object prints a rectangle with #, if repr is used it creates a valid structure to print and eval. |
| [5-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/5-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with attributes width and height and has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area, if you print the object prints a rectangle with #, if repr is used it creates a valid structure to print and eval and prints a goodbye message when instance is deleted. |
| [6-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/6-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with private attributes width and height and number of instances as class attribute, has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area, if you print the object prints a rectangle with #, if repr is used it creates a valid structure to print and eval and prints a goodbye message when instance is deleted. |
| [7-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/7-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with private attributes width and height and number of instances as class attribute, has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area, if you print the object prints a rectangle with specified class attribute, if repr is used it creates a valid structure to print and eval and prints a goodbye message when instance is deleted. |
| [8-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/8-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with private attributes width and height and number of instances as class attribute, has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area, if you print the object prints a rectangle with #, if repr is used it creates a valid structure to print and eval and prints a goodbye message when instance is deleted. Has static method to determine larger rectangle. |
| [9-rectangle.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/9-rectangle.py) | Creates a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with private attributes width and height and number of instances as class attribute, has methods to evaluate its perimeter and area, if you print the object prints a rectangle with #, if repr is used it creates a valid structure to print and eval and prints a goodbye message when instance is deleted. Has static method to determine larger rectangle. Has a class method to create an instance with a square. |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
Each file is a script and executes with python3. Thereby each executable can be processed as:

```
./name_of_file.py
```
Nevertheless, these files need a test file to see the application, which is the one that is going to be executed.


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on high level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in Python_

## Authors ‚úíÔ∏è

**Adriana Echeverri** - [adri-er](https://github.com/adri-er)


This project was developed following the schedule of the foundations program in Holberton.
