# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

With this project I had a my first contact with Test Driven Development, creating testing text files with Doctest and testing classes with unittest. As well, the difference between the two cases was studied in depth in the development of each file. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description. 

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-add_integer.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-python-test_driven_development/0-add_integer.py) | Function that adds two integers specified in parameters. |
| [2-matrix_divided.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-python-test_driven_development/2-matrix_divided.py) | Function that divides all elements of a matrix. |
| [3-say_my_name.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-python-test_driven_development/3-say_my_name.py) | Function that prints My name is first name last name. |
| [4-print_square.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-python-test_driven_development/4-print_square.py) | Function that prints a square with the character #. |
| [5-text_indentation.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-python-test_driven_development/5-text_indentation.py) | Function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and : |
| [tests](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x07-python-test_driven_development/tests) | In this folder, testing for each of the cases above is found, the test corresponding to each case start with an equivalent number. |


## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
Each file is a script and executes with python3. Thereby each executable can be processed as:

```
./name_of_file.py
```
Nevertheless, these files have a test file associated, to execute the file with the related tests:

```
python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/name_of_file.txt
```

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on high level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in Python_

## Authors ‚úíÔ∏è

This project was developed following the schedule of the foundations program in Holberton.
