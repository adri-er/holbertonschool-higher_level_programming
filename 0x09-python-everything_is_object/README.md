# Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

With this project I had a closer contact with how everything is an object in Python, understanding mutable and immutable objects and how does this affect while programming in this language. This gave me knowledge of what and when a variable is a reference, an assigment or an alias. As well, how does Python pass variables to a function in which cases it changes and when it causes nothing. The files in this repository are not related to python coding or functions, they are mainly text files that answer to a series of questions.  

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [19-copy_list.py](https://github.com/adri-er/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x09-python-everything_is_object/19-copy_list.py) | Function that returns the copy a list. |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation of python file:
The file is a script and executes with python3. Thereby the executable can be processed as:

```
./name_of_file.py
```
Nevertheless, these files need a test file to see the application, which is the one that is going to be executed.


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on high level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in Python. In this case some alternative text files answering to questions make part of the repo._
