# Python dictionaries and sets

With this project I had the first contact with some pythons data structures, dictionaries and sets, some of its processing _such as adding, accessing and removing data, concatenating, comparing data, using built-in functions such as keys, values, del, max, count, index and more_. In the next table can be found the files in the repo and a description. 

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| []() |  |
| []() |  |
| []() |  |
| []() |  |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

For correct compilation:
Each file is a script and executes with python3. Thereby each executable can be processed as:

```
./name_of_file.py
```


## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

_The whole repository based on high level programming phase of Holberton School foundations is constructed in Python_

## Authors ‚úíÔ∏è
